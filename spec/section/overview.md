## Overview {#overview}

*This section is non-normative.*

RDF-star [[RDF-star]] is an extension of the Resource Description Framework (RDF) [[RDF11-Concepts]]. RDF covers triples that are built from three terms: subject, predicate and object, and each term is either an IRI, a blank node or a literal. RDF-star adds a fourth kind of term: the RDF-star triple. With RDF-star, it is possible to represent metadata about individual triples.

# This RDF-star example says that the triple ( :Alice a :Person ) is 80% likely to be true
<< :Alice a :Person >> :confidence 0.8 .
</pre>

RDF-star distinguishes between different types of [RDF-star triples](https://www.w3.org/2021/12/rdf-star.html#dfn-triple): depending on where a triple [occurs](https://www.w3.org/2021/12/rdf-star.html#occurrences), it can be either an [asserted triple](https://www.w3.org/2021/12/rdf-star.html#dfn-asserted), a [quoted triple](https://www.w3.org/2021/12/rdf-star.html#dfn-quoted), or both asserted and quoted. For a given [RDF-star graph](https://www.w3.org/2021/12/rdf-star.html#dfn-graph), i.e., for a given set of RDF-star triples, an <dfn data-lt="asserted">asserted triple</dfn> is a triple that is an element of the graph. A <dfn data-lt="quoted">quoted triple</dfn> is a triple that occurs as the subject or object of another triple. Quoted triples can also be called "embedded triples".

The RDF Mapping Language (RML) [[RML]] is a language for expressing mappings between heterogeneous data and RDF. In RML, rules can be expressed to iterate over a data source and refer to specific data within an iteration. Using these iterators and references, RML rules define how to express data in the data source in RDF. RML is based on and extends R2RML [[R2RML]]. R2RML is defined to express customized mappings only from relational databases to RDF datasets.

This document describes RML-star:
an extension of RML that enables the generation of RDF-star triples with RML.

### Conformance {#conformance}
As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.

### Document conventions {#conventions}
We assume readers have basic familiarity with RDF, RML and RDF-star concepts.

In this document, examples assume
the following namespace prefix bindings unless otherwise stated:

| Prefix | Namespace                         |
| ------ | --------------------------------- |
| `rml:` | http://w3id.org/rml/              |
| `xsd:` | http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema# |
| `ex:`  | http://example.org/               |
| `:`    | http://example.org/               |

The examples are contained in color-coded boxes. We use the Turtle syntax [[Turtle]] to write RDF and the Turtle-star syntax [[RDF-star]] to write RDF-star.
